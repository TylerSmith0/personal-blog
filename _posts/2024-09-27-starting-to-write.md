# Starting to Write

Hi Tyler (and anyone else that may be reading),

Today I'm kicking off what I intend to be a series of weekly articles that cover a wide array of things that I learn throughout the weeks. I'm trying to focus on technical skill improvements, but also am very interested in things like mindfulness, health and fitness, and so on.

That being said, there's no real structure for what these articles will cover. It's going to be more of a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants approach to writing. Sometimes I suppose I'll write tutorials, sometimes I'll just slap up some words and hope they make coherent sentences. But it will be fun nonetheless, and a good way for me to practice my writing skills.

I've tried journaling in the mornings, but haven't found it to stick in my routine quite yet â€” being a software engineer, I tend to gravitate towards the computer once I get my coffee poured. (Shocker, I know.) Yet the days that I have journaled, I've found it to have a very positive impact on my mood throughout the day â€” yet *I just can't do it every morning*. I have one of those daily journals that only has about 4 lines per day, and it's meant to be used over the course of 5 years. But if you flip through the pages, you'll find several weeks at a time of blank days, followed by me saying the same thing the day I re-start: "*Man, this journaling thing is hard! Soâ€¦*"

Since most of my journaling involved me just regurgitating what I did at work that week, things I was proud of, and things I was worried about, I figured why not post all of these accomplishments and deepest, darkest fears on the internet? What could go wrong with that? Hence, this blog. ðŸŽ‰

Thanks for joining, and I'm shocked you even found the site.
